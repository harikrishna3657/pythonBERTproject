Sure, this film's digital CGI is dazzling on the surface, but I found that Avatar was all flash and no substance. The overuse of computer effects just came off as cheap to me, though that largely depends on the preferences of the individual viewer, and I found it impossible to relate to the characters or even to like them. Certainly a lot of undeniable hard work went into Avatar, and to be fair I don't think it's absolutely loathsome or terrible - just terribly overrated, and I'm sick of people always raving about it to me.
